trumps-fist
==============================

Various attempts to classify Trump's tweets. In 2016, Candidate Trump used an Android to tweet and his staff used iPhones. This provides a labeled set of data that, in theory, can be used to build a model to determine who is tweeting under @realDonaldTrump.

To reproduce, install docker, and nvidia-docker (assuming a GPU). Then navigate to 'docker' and type 'make notebook'. This will build a docker container and execute Jupyter Notebook. It downloads a couple of large data files. You may need to modify some of the paths for your system.
